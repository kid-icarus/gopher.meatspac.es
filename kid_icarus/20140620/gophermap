Exit the train.
The acute prick of a blood orange sun
draws the eyes to the ground.

Walk up the hill.
Eyes hanging low.

Walk up the steps.
Notice boots.
A caramel hue,
teeh gnashing, brass teeth,
a zipper.

Walk down the block.
Take a right.
Notice boots,
moving faster.

Why are they moving faster?
Two objects
Drifting through space.

'Is this person scared of me?'
'Am I a scary person?'
'Is this fear the manifestation
 of an entire history of oppression?'
'Maybe if my teeth were straighter, brighter.'
'Maybe if I were younger.'

Feel a tension.
Take a deep breath.
Slow the pace,
let a negative space balloon
between the ojbects.

Be present with the fear,
the fear of the other.
'Am I scarier with thumbs hooking into pockets?
 Or with arms dangling, without purpose?'

Take a right.
Up the stairs.
Notice boots.

The sound of a key
slowly lifts the pins of a lock.

To a door.
Your door.
Your neighbor.

'Hi, my name is Shannon'
Notice a hand,
put forth,
a guesture.

Extending the arm,
the Earth trembles.
A prism emerges,
splitting light into an anaglyph,
of Cyan, Magenta.

Clasp the hand.
Witness dandelion seeds in the wind.
Objects drifting through space.

Fall into the void.
